    "# Notebook-II: Tutorial on LLM-Based Evaluation with AITutor-AssessmentKit  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on evaluating large language model (LLM)-based AI tutors using automated evaluation metrics provided by [AITutor-AssessmentKit]() on [MRBench]() data. This tutorial demonstrates how to leverage state-of-the-art evaluation techniques to assess the pedagogical efficacy of AI tutors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation Across 8 Pedagogical Dimensions**:  \n",
    "  Drawing inspiration from the foundational principles of learning proposed by Maurya et al. (2024), this evaluation framework focuses on the following dimensions:  \n",
    "  1. *Mistake Identification*  \n",
    "  2. *Mistake Location*  \n",
    "  3. *Revealing the Answer*  \n",
    "  4. *Providing Guidance*  \n",
    "  5. *Actionability*  \n",
    "  6. *Coherence*  \n",
    "  7. *Tutor Tone*  \n",
    "  8. *Humanlikeness*  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assessment of Student Mistake Remediation in the Mathematical Domain**:  \n",
    "  For a given partial conversation between a tutor and a student, where the student's last utterance demonstrates a mistake or confusion, the automated evaluation provides detailed insights into the tutor's performance across the specified dimensions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation with LLMs as Critics/Evaluators**:  \n",
    "  The AITutor-AssessmentKit leverages open-source LLMs as evaluators to assess the pedagogical efficacy of tutor responses and generate scores for each dimension. While any LLM can be employed, this tutorial demonstrates the process using the *Prometheus2* LLM as an example.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:  \n",
    "1. Understand how to use LLMs to evaluate AI tutors on each pedagogical dimension.  \n",
    "2. Display tutor responses alongside their corresponding LLM-based evaluation scores for selected dimension.  \n",
    "3. Compare responses and evaluations from two tutors using LLMs as critics for specific dimensions.  \n",
    "4. Generate and save comprehensive evaluation reports across all dimensions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial is designed to equip you with the expertise and tools necessary to systematically evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of AI tutors in addressing student challenges.  "

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, so he took 10,000/2 = 5000 steps during these walks.\\nAdding the 1,000 steps he took with his friend, he has taken 5000+1000 = 6000 steps.\\nSubtracting 6000 from his goal of 10,000, he has 10,000-6000 = 4000 steps left to take.\\nTherefore, he took 4000 steps during his jog.\\xa0\\n\\xa04000\\xa0\\n\\xa0Tutor: can you tell me how you got to your answer?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Sure. I started by figuring out how many steps Elliott had taken before his jog.

Then I added the 1000 steps he took with his friend so I had taken 5000+1000 = 6000 steps. After that I subtracted 6000 from his goal of 10000 so I had 10000-6000 = 4000 steps left to take.

The question is: Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils. If her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils, how many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Jam has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in her boxes.\\nTogether, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.\\nEach box holds 24 pencils, so they need 70/24 = 2.92 boxes.\\nSince they can't have a fraction of a box, they need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes.\\nTherefore, they need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.\\n\\xa03\\xa0\\n\\xa0Tutor: can you walk me through your solution?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Sure! I started by figuring out how many pencils Jam had in her boxes. She had 3 boxes with 26 pencils in total but 2 of those were loose so I subtracted 2 from 26 to get 24. Then I added the 24 pencils that Jam had to the 46 pencils that Meg had to get a total of 70 pencils. Since each box holds 24 pencils I divided 70 by 24 to get 2.92. Since you can't have a fraction of a box I rounded up to the nearest whole number which was 3. So Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.\\xa0\\n\\xa0Tutor: That number seems too low.. How would we work out how many pencils can be stored in a box?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: To work out how many pencils can be stored in a box we need to divide the total number of pencils (70) by the number of boxes (3). So 70 divided by 3 is equal to 24. That means each box can store 24 pencils.\",\n",

For example, if you have 10 $10 gift cards, 5 $25 gift cards, and 3 $50 gift cards, the total value would be (10 * $10) + (5 * $25) + (3 * $50), which equals $100 + $125 + $150, giving a total value of $375.\\n\\n### User:\\nHow can I determine the average value of my gift cards if I have a mix of denominations?\\n\\n### Assistant:\\nTo find the average value of your gift cards, first calculate the total value of all your gift cards as described previously. Then, divide the total value by the total number of gift cards. For example, if you have 10 $10 gift cards, 5 $25 gift cards, and 3 $50 gift cards, the total value is $375, and the total number of gift cards is 18. Dividing $375 by 18 gives an average value of approximately $20.83 per gift card.\\n\\n### User:\\nWhat if I want to exchange some of my gift cards for ones with higher values?\\n\\n### Assistant:\\nExchanging gift cards typically depends on the policies of the retailer or issuer. Some may allow exchanges within a certain timeframe or for a fee, while others may not permit exchanges at all. It's best to check with the specific retailer or issuer to understand their exchange policies and any potential fees involved.\\n\\n### User:\\nIs there a way to combine multiple gift cards into one larger value gift card?\\n\\n### Assistant:\\nSome retailers or third-party services offer gift card consolidation services, allowing you to combine multiple gift cards into one larger value gift card.

What does he need to roll on the next roll to be able to stop?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: We can start by finding the average of all his rolls so far:\\n(1+3+2+4+3+5+3+4+4+2) / 10 = 32 / 10 = 3.2\\nTo stop rolling, Ronald needs the average of all his rolls to be 3, so we can set up an equation:\\n(1+3+2+4+3+5+3+4+4+2+x) / 11 = 3\\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\\n(29+x) / 11 = 3\\nMultiplying both sides by 11, we get:\\n29+x = 33\\nSubtracting 29 from both sides, we get:\\nx = 4\\nTherefore, Ronald needs to roll a 4 on the next roll to be able to stop.\\n\\xa04\\xa0\\n\\xa0Tutor: which was 3.2. Then I set up an equation to find what Ronald needs to roll on the next roll to get the average to 3.

3.2\\nto stop rolling, ronald needs the average of all his rolls to be 3, so we can set up an equation:\\n(1+3+2+4+3+5+3+4+4+2+x) / 11 = 3\\nsimplifying the equation, we get:\\n(29+x) / 11 = 3\\nmultiplying both sides by 11, we get:\\n29+x = 33\\nsubtracting 29 from both sides, we get:\\nx = 4\\ntherefore, ronald needs to roll a 4 on the next roll to be able to stop.\\n4 ||| tutor: which was 3.2. then i set up an equation to find what ronald needs to roll on the next roll to get the average to 3. i multiplied both sides of the equation by 11 subtracted 29 from both sides and then got the answer of 4. ||| tutor: what is the total number that ronald has rolled before his last roll? ||| student: the total number that ronald has rolled before his last roll is 29. ||| tutor: what total would ronald need to have an average of 3? ||| student: to have an average of 3 ronald would need a total of 33. |||\", 'Data': 'MathDial', 'Split': 'test', 'Topic': 'Not Available',
