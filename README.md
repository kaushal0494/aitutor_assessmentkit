# **`AITutor-AssessmentKit:` An Open-Source Library to Measure Pedagogical Ability of AI Tutors in Educational Dialogues**

---

The `AITutor-AssessmentKit` is the *first* open-source library to enable the pedagogical abilities assessment of large language model (LLM)-powered AI tutors in educational dialogues. This unified framework:

- **Evaluates AI tutor responses** across eight comprehensive dimensions in the context of student error remediation tasks in mathematics
- **Offers a pluggable and customizable interface** for integrating models and LLM releases from the community.

By providing an efficient, scalable alternative to costly and subjective human evaluations, `AITutor-AssessmentKit` facilitates *on-the-fly* assessment of AI tutors.

## **Reference**
The toolkit is developed based on the evaluation taxonomy proposed by [Maurya et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09416).

## ðŸ“¥ **Installation**

To install `AITutor-AssessmentKit` with `pip`, type:

```bash
pip install aitutor-assessmentkit
```

## ðŸ“š **Overview of the `AITutor-AssessmentKit`**

The library comprises three modular components:

1. **`autoeval`**: For automated evaluation.
2. **`llmeval`**: For LLM-based evaluation.
3. **`visualizer`**: For visualization and interpretation of evaluation scores.
